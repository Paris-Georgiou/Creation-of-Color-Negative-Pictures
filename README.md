# Creation-of-Color-Negative-Pictures

This project was assigned during my C++ course in my Bachelor's curriculum and revolves around understanding the C++ programming language.

I had to take imagines that were saved in ppm format and create their color negative variation.

When you start the program, it will ask you to type the file name of the image you want to load. If there is any problem with the format or the opening of the image it will print out the appropriate error message. Otherwise it will create a file that will contain the new color negative image.
